The idea of Q-learning is to learn the action-value function, often denoted as Q(s, a) , where s represents the current state and a represents the action being evaluated. Q-learning is a form of Temporal-Difference learning (TD-learning), where unlike Monte-Carlo methods, we can learn from each step rather than waiting for an episode to complete. The idea is that once we take an action and are thrust into a new state, we use the current Q-value of that state as the estimate for future rewards.
